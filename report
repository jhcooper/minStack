the program either pushes numbers into the stack, pops them, or finds the minimum from the values.
 The program's runtime is O(1).
 the push function is modified to keep track of the min; however, the modifications are if statements so the run time stays the same.
 the pop function is modified to change the running min if the min is popped; however, this was also with if statements so the runtime stays the same.
 the findmin function only returns the min value which is constant; therefore, the runtime stays O(1).
